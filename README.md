# Hospital_Module

 To create Module Using Scaffold Command In Odoo we need to put the terminal in the directory where is the odoo-bin, next we need to put the next command

  C:\odoo15\odoo\venv\Scripts\python.exe ./odoo-bin scaffold om_odoo_inheritance C:\odoo15\odoo\custom_addons

  firts the we have to put the path of the exe of python then the path of the odoo-bin next the scaffold next the name of the module and finally the path where we want the module. This will make all the structure of the module.
